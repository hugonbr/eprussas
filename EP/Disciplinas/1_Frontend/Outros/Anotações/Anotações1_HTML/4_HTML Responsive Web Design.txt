Responsive web design is about creating web pages that
look good on all devices!

A responsive web design will automatically adjust for
different screen sizes and viewports.

Setting The Viewport
To create a responsive website, add the following <meta>
tag to all your web pages:

All web doc
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

Image
<img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:100%;">

"max-width:100%" prevents the image from getting bigger than
its original size. However, if you make the browser window
smaller, the image will still scale down.
<img src="img_girl.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">

Text
The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".
<h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1>
