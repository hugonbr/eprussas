Class Example
In this example only <p> elements with class="center" will
be red and center-aligned: 

p.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.

Example
In this example the <p> element will be styled according to
class="center" and to class="large": 

<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>

The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

In this example we have grouped the selectors from the code above: 

h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
