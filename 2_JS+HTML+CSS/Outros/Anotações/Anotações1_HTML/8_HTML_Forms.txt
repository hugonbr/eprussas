The Method Attribute

The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get")
or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").

The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. 

Notes on GET:
Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

Notes on POST:
Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

The Autocomplete Attribute
<form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on">
