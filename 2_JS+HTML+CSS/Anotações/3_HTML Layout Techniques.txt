HTML Layout Techniques
There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts.
Each technique has its pros and cons:

1) CSS framework
2) CSS float property
3) CSS flexbox
4) CSS grid

1) CSS Frameworks
If you want to create your layout fast,
you can use a CSS framework, like W3.CSS or Bootstrap.

2) CSS Float Layout
It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property.
Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and
clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the
document flow, which may harm the flexibility.
Learn more about float in our CSS Float and Clear chapter.

3) CSS Flexbox Layout
Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the
page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and
different display devices.
