A URL is another word for a web address.

A URL can be composed of words (e.g. w3schools.com), or
an Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g. 192.68.20.50).

scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename

Explanation:

scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)
domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)
port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)
path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)
filename - defines the name of a document or resource

URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces
a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20.
